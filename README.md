# GameCourse
An open source game development course. 

We aim to develop an open-source curriculum covering essential game development skills, focusing on practical application rather than theoretical depth. The course will prioritize rapid onboarding through project-driven approaches, enabling learners to create playable game prototypes they're passionate about. We encourage collective development and optimization through community collaboration - initially leveraging existing free resources like documentation (e.g., Godot's official guides) and video tutorials (similar to Unity Learn's structure). Later phases will implement gap analysis to update outdated content and maintain currency, adopting quality control mechanisms used in successful open-source education projects. This living curriculum will evolve through contributor feedback loops and version control systems, mirroring best practices from active developer communities


想要开发一个开源的包含大部分游戏开发需要的技能的课程，不求理论多深，争取能够尽快上手，以实际项目为导向，开发出自己喜欢的游戏。希望能够群策群力，与大家共同发展和优化这个课程，初期会以现有的免费资源为主，包括但不限于文档和视频教程。后期查缺补漏，填补或者是更新现有的课程遗漏的点，或者是就不更新的课程内容，使之保持时新。
